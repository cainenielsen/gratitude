      <p>
        We love you mom. I mean, obviously we are greatful for you. You are
        still raising us today, even though some of us are grown or have just
        joined the family. You show us what it really means to be a mother and
        to take care of the the ones you love. We are so greatful for that and
        we hope you have an amazing Thanksgiving.
