          Hey! I just wanted to show how much I appreciate you. You do such an
          amazing job every day leading this team, helping us deliver the most
          value, and honestly just being a good friend. Thank you. I hope you
          have an amazing Thanksgiving.
        </p>

          P.S. I made this Nuxt app to share my family's thankfulness. It makes
          it so easy to write gratitude-grams.
