        Hey Rebekah. I love you. I appreciate everything you do for our family.
        I love how much you help people, like your Aunt and my mom with
        Thanksgiving dinner. I love how you take the time to wish everyone a
        happy thanksgiving, and more than all, I adore how you show your love
        everyday.
